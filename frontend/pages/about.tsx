              NerdTree started as a group in the IT club of Ongko Organization
              in 2019. With more than 50 active members, NerdTree was one of the
              most active group in Ongko. More than 10 workshops were done
              within 2 years.
              <br />
              <br />
              Now NerdTree is an independent organization. Aiming to spread the
              knowledge of programming among general people. With our own
              website with blogging, itâ€™s never been easier to do that.
